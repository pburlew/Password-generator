# Password-generator

An in-browser app that prompts user to enter password length and character criteria. A password is randomized and produced based on user inputs.


USE: Press the "Generate Password" button to start the prompts. You'll see different prompts appear asking for your password criteria. Select "yes" to include this character type in your password and "cancel" to exclude the listed character type from your password. Passwords must be a minimum of at least 8 characters and include at least one case type. 

The randomized password will be displayed in the window. You can click refresh or open in a new broswer to create new randomized passwords.
